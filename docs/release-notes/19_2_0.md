## 19.2.0
(2019-08-20)

This is a GraalVM feature release, we recommend upgrading to it from the 19.1.x or older releases.

### Native Image

We simplified the process of collecting data for profile-guided optimizations (PGO) for GraalVM Enterprise native images. PGO allows to optimize performance of native images by analyzing collected profiles during the image generation process. Since 19.2.0 you can collect data for PGO while running your application in a just-in-time (JIT) compiled mode: 
```
$ /graal-ee-19.2.0/bin/java -Dgraal.PGOInstrument=myclass.iprof MyClass
$ /graal-ee-19.2.0/bin/native-image --pgo=myclass.iprof MyClass
$ ./myclass
```

### Performance

We improved throughput for native image in GraalVM Enterprise when no profiles are available. Running the [Micronaut GraalVM example](https://guides.micronaut.io/micronaut-creating-first-graal-app/guide/index.html) shows spending ~10% less CPU time and achieving a ~10% higher throughput of requests per CPU second in 19.2.

We also solved a common usability problem when a class marked for
initialization at runtime gets inadvertently initialized at build time. The flag `-H:+TraceClassInitialization` was
introduced to help tracing what
classes got initialized at runtime.

### JavaScript
* We added support for date, time, timezone, instant and duration interoperability
types to distinguish date-like objects from multiple
languages in polyglot contexts (see changes to GraalVM SDK and Truffle APIs).
* Added `Context.Builder.timeZone` to set the time zone.
* We implemented the [Numeric separators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-numeric-separator) TC39 proposal. It is
available in ECMAScript 2020 mode (`--js.ecmascript-version=2020`).
* We moved ICU data for internationalization APIs, e.g. date and time formatting, number formatting, collation for each individual supported language, previously distributed as separate files in `<GRAALVM_HOME>/jre/languages/js/icu4j/icudt` to the executable of JavaScript (`js`).

More changes are listed in the JavaScript component [changelog](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-1920).

### LLVM Interpreter
We added preliminary support for compiling native programs to bitcode using
the LLVM toolchain. The LLVM toolchain is a set of tools and APIs for compiling
native projects, such as C and C++, to bitcode that can be executed with the
GraalVM LLVM runtime. It is aimed to simplify ahead-of-time compilation for
users and language implementers who want to use the GraalVM LLVM runtime. To do
so, we provide launchers that invoke the C/C++ compiler with special flags to
produce results that can be executed by the GraalVM LLVM runtime. For more
details, please consult the [LLVM reference documentation]({{"/docs/reference-manual/languages/llvm/#llvm-toolchain/" | relative_url }}).

The toolchain is an [experimental](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/enterprise/19/guide/overview/license/licensing-information.html) feature in this release.
A complete list of changes to GraalVM LLVM runtime can be found in the
[changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sulong/CHANGELOG.md#version-1920).

### Ruby
A comprehensive list of changes to Ruby language component is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1920). Major changes include:

* Implemented support for Fiddle -- an extension to translate a foreign function interface (FFI) and [libffi](http://sourceware.org/libffi/) wrapper for Ruby.
* In terms of compatibility, `Thread.report_on_exception` is now `true` by default
like MRI 2.5+; `BigDecimal` compatibility has been generally improved in several
ways.
* Improved the performance by optimizing `String` methods to use the vector
instructions when searching for a single-byte character in a `String`.
* Fixed several bugs reported by community:
  * Set `RbConfig::CONFIG['ruby_version']` to the same value as the TruffleRuby version. This fixes reusing C extensions between different versions of TruffleRuby with Bundler ([#1715](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1715)).
  * Improved errors when interacting with single-threaded languages ([#1709](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1709)).

### R
* Added a new `fastRCluster` package that allows to run FastR inside GNU-R:
  1. install in GNU-R or RStudio with: `devtools::install_github('oracle/fastr/com.oracle.truffle.r.pkgs/fastRCluster')`;
  2. use `?fastRCluster` to learn more.

* The problem that `SET_ATTRIB` does not validate the attributes as expected was resolved.

The [changelog](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is available on GitHub.


### Python
The GraalVM Python implementation is still experimental and we are working towards improving completeness.
* Implemented `PyStructSequence_*` C API -- standard structured prediction functions.
* Added support for more C API functions as `PyEval_InitThreads` and `PyEval_ThreadsInitialized`, type attributes i.e. `nb_remainder`, `nb_subtract`, `overflowed` and `recursion_depth` thread state fields.
* Fixed printing of errors in the REPL and full paths in tracebacks.

More details are available in the project [changelog](https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-1920) on GitHub.

### API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)
We implemented the ability to configure custom polyglot access configuration with
`PolyglotAccess.newBuilder()`. It allows to configure fine-grained access
control for polyglot bindings and between polyglot languages. For example, given
a `TruffleObject` as a value, there is a need to determine language and type of
that object. This feature is significant for GraalVM execution inside [Oracle
RDBMS](https://oracle.github.io/oracle-db-mle/).

GraalVM 19.2.0 release also added support for date, time, timezone, duration
values in polyglot APIs, and introduced the `Context.Builder.timeZone(ZoneId)`
class to configure the default timezone of polyglot contexts.

The major GraalVM SDK and Truffle APIs changes between the versions are summarized in:
- [GraalVM SDK changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sdk/CHANGELOG.md#version-1920)
- [GraalVM Truffle changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/CHANGELOG.md#version-1920)

### Tools
A preview version of Java Flight Recorder (JFR) support has been released as a plugin for the VisualVM tool bundled with GraalVM 19.2.0. The plugin reads all JFR snapshots created from Java 7 and newer and presents the data in typical VisualVM views familiar for its users.

![](/docs/img/visualvm_jfr.png)

To install the JFR support, download GraalVM 19.2.0 from [graalvm.org/downloads]({{"/downloads" | relative_url }}), unzip it and run <GRAALVM_HOME>/bin/jvisualvm to start VisualVM. 
Use `Tools | Plugins | Available Plugins` to list all available plugins and install the VisualVM-JFR and VisualVM-JFR-Generic modules.
The JFR snapshots can be opened using either the File | Load… action or by double-clicking the JFR Snapshots node and adding the snapshot into the JFR repository permanently. 
Please follow the documentation of your Java installation how to create JFR snapshots.

JFR support is currently an
[experimental](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/enterprise/19/guide/overview/license/licensing-information.html)
feature. Some advanced features like analyzing JVM internals, showing event
stack traces or support for creating JFR snapshots from live processes are not
available in the preview version and will be addressed incrementally in the
following releases.

### GraalVM Updater Utility 

We fixed an issue where GraalVM Enterprise would by default download the GraalVM CE components from GitHub. If you're using GraalVM CE nothing changes, you can still install the components as before, and the `gu` will locate the necessary jar files on GitHub and correctly install them: 
```
gu install native-image ruby R python
```

If you're using GraalVM Enterprise, you can install R and llvm-toolchain components from GitHub, for example:
```
gu install R
```

The other components are available from [the OTN page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/graalvm/downloads/index.html), and can be installed from a manually downloaded file, for example to install `native-image` support run: 
```
gu install --file native-image-installable-svm-svmee-darwin-amd64-19.2.0.jar
```

### Version Calendar

You can now refer to [GraalVM version calendar]({{"/docs/release-notes/version-roadmap/" | relative_url }}) to learn more about the GraalVM release model and prepare for upcoming releases.
