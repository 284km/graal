## 1.0-RC13
(2019-03-05)

### Tools
**Ideal Graph Visualizer**

With GraalVM 1.0-RC13 release, there has been a significant change to the
Ideal Graph Visualizer developer tool. The default behavior of the `Dgraal.Dump`
option has changed in that IGV dumps are now written to the local file system by default.
To get the old behavior of dumping straight to an IGV instance listening on _127.0.0.1:4445_,
you need to add `-Dgraal.PrintGraph=Network` option.
If a network connection cannot be opened, dumping falls back to file system dumping.

**Graal VisualVM**

Another developer tool, Graal VisualVM, now allows Heap monitoring of native-image processes.

### R
* R specific command line options are now passed as `–R.PrintErrorStackTracesToFile=true` instead of using JVM properties (`–jvm.R:+PrintErrorStackTracesToFile`). You can view available options with `--help:languages`.
* Optional post installation script, _configure_fastr_, also regenerates _etc/Renviron_ and _etc/ldpaths_ files according to the target system.
* R vectors are not writeable from other languages, because this would violate the R language semantics.

A list of changes to GraalVM implementation of R is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-13).

### JavaScript
* Node.js updated from 10.15.0 to version 10.15.2.
* Made JavaScript and Java interoperability available in native images. Note that you have to configure the accessible classes and methods at native image build time (see [reflection configuration](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/REFLECTION.md#manual-configuration)).
* Node.js `Worker` class should be used instead of deprecated experimental `Java.Worker` API now.
* A deprecated `NashornJavaInterop` mode was removed.

More details can be found in the [project changelog](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc13) on GitHub.

### LLVM interpreter (Sulong)

* Added the support for embedded bitcode in Mach-O files. We support bitcode in the `__bitcode` section of Mach-O object files, as well as bitcode files in an embedded xar archive in the `__bundle` section of executables or `dylibs`. For example, on OS X, you can compile your code with `clang -fembed-bitcode -flto hello.c -o hello`, creating a native executable with embedded bitcode. You can then run it natively (`./hello`) or with GraalVM (`$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/lli ./hello`).

The full [project changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sulong/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc13) is available on GitHub.

### Ruby

This release of GraalVM is rich in performance and compatibility improvements,
multiple changes and bug fixes for Ruby implementation.

An extensive list of all updates is available on  [Github](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-13).  Here is a short list of most notable ones:

New features:

* Host interoperability with Java now works on SubstrateVM too.

Changes:

* `-Xoptions` has been deprecated and will be removed. Use `--help:languages` instead.
* `-Xlog=` has been deprecated and will be removed. Use `--log.level=` instead.
* `-J` has been deprecated and will be removed. Use `--jvm.` instead.
* `-J-cp lib.jar` and so on have been deprecated and will be removed. Use
  `--jvm.cp=lib.jar` or `--jvm.classpath=lib.jar` instead.
* `-J-cmd`, `--jvm.cmd`, `JAVA_HOME`, `JAVACMD`, and `JAVA_OPTS` do not work in any released
  configuration of TruffleRuby, so have been removed.
* `-Xoption=value` has been deprecated and will be removed. Use `--option=value` instead.
* `TracePoint.trace` and `TracePoint#inspect` have been implemented.

Compatibility:

* Improved the exception when an `-S` file is not found.
* Removed the message from exceptions raised by bare `raise` to better match MRI [#1487](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1487).
* `TracePoint` now handles the `:class` event.

Note that GraalVM 1.0-RC13 implementation of Ruby is built on Ruby 2.4.4, and it
is still vulnerable to CVE-2018-16395. This will be fixed in the next release.

### Python

New feature:

* Allow installation of NumPy in a `venv`. Just run e.g. `bin/graalpython -m venv numpy_env; source numpy_env/bin/activate; graalpython -m ginstall install numpy`. Note that not all NumPy features work at the moment.

### API changes for GraalVM integrators (SDK + Truffle)

* Added [Debugger.getSessionCount()](https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/debug/Debugger.html#getSessionCount--) to return the number of active debugger sessions.
* `TruffleLanguage` class now can register additional services. This change also deprecates the automatic registration of the language class as a service.
* [`OptionCategory.DEBUG`](https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/org/graalvm/options/OptionCategory.html) has been renamed to `OptionCategory.INTERNAL` for clarity.
* Added `static` member to class objects that provides access to the class's static members.
* [`OptionStability`](https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/org/graalvm/options/OptionStability.html)
has been added for specifying the stability of an option.

All Truffle and Graal SDK changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:
