## 1.0-RC16
(2019-04-23)

### Java

We addressed several benchmarks that had slower performance when running with the GraalVM compiler built as a native library, also known as [libgraal](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/compiler#libgraal), a mode selected as the default in the last release candidate. We fixed an issue causing a delay when shutting down the virtual machine process at the end of the execution of an application
(see [#1140](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1140)).

### Native Image
We improved the structure of the `org.graalvm.nativeimage` API: classes that can
only be used during image generation are now in the package
`org.graalvm.nativeimage.hosted`, to clearly separate them from the classes that
can be used at image run time. In order to stay backwards compatible, the
original classes are still present, but marked as deprecated. They will be
deleted in the next release candidate, so please update to the new classes.

We fixed several bugs that were reported on GitHub, including an
issue with the logging framework which materialized as an error that no instances of `java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter` are allowed in the image heap.

As a result, native images work now correctly with **Helidon**, a Java
framework designed for writing microservices which recently announced their
support for GraalVM native images:

### Ruby
A complete [changelog](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-16)
 for the Ruby component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:

* Rounding modes have been implemented or improved for `Float`, `Rational`, `BigDecimal` classes (see [#1509](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1509)).
* Added a pure-Ruby implementation of Foreign Function Interface (FFI) which passes almost all Ruby FFI specs (see [#1529](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1529)).
* The `KeyError` raised from `ENV#fetch` and `Hash#fetch` now matches MRI's message formatting (see [#1633](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1633)).

### JavaScript

A complete [changelog](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc16)
 for the JavaScript component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:

* [Loading JavaScript source code](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/docs/user/JavaScriptCompatibility.md#loadsource) from URLs is now guarded by the
`js.load-from-url` command line option and prohibited by default.

### R

A complete [changelog](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-16)
 for the R component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:

* Allow parsing any letter in identifiers
including, e.g., Japanese, with `lexer` starting from 1.0-RC16, which matches
GNU-R behavior.

### Python

* Improved startup time of the `graalpython` native launcher.

### LLVM Runtime

* The `lli` launcher now starts with the locale set to `C`.
