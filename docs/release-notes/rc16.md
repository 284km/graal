## 1.0-RC16
(2019-04-23)

### GraalVM for Java Developers

We addressed several benchmarks that had slower performance on the GraalVM compiler built as a native library, also known as [libgraal](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/compiler#libgraal)  than non-libgraal (disabled with `-XX:-UseJVMCINativeLibrary`), i.e. _JavaGraal_ benchmark. We added support for complex
intrinsics to libgraal, closing remaining peak performance gaps with _JavaGraal_,
and fixed libgraal specific issue causing delay in shutting down the VM for
short executions (see [#1140](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1140)).

### Native Image
We improved the structure of the `org.graalvm.nativeimage` API: classes that can
only be used during image generation are now in the package
`org.graalvm.nativeimage.hosted`, to clearly separate them from the classes that
can be used at image run time. In order to not make this a breaking change, the
original classes are still present, but marked as deprecated. They will be
deleted in the next release candidate, so please update to the new classes.

##### Bug Fixes
As always, we fixed several bugs that were reported on GitHub, including the
issue with the logging framework which materialized as `No instances are allowed
in the image heap for a class that is initialized or reinitialized at image
runtime: java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter` error.

As a result in RC16 native images work for example with **Helidon**, a Java
framework designed for writing microservices which recently announced their
support for GraalVM native images:
[Helidon flies faster with GraalVM](https://medium.com/oracledevs/helidon-flies-faster-with-graalvm-eea85287d2dc).

### Ruby
Ruby language component received updates in terms of compatibility improvements,
new functionalities, bug fixes. A complete
[changelog](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-16)
is available on GitHub.  The highlights include:

##### New Features
Rounding modes have been implemented or improved for `Float`, `Rational`, `BigDecimal` classes (see [#1509](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1509)).
Added a pure-Ruby implementation of Foreign Function Interface (FFI) which passes almost all Ruby FFI specs (see [#1529](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1529)).

##### Compatibility
The `KeyError` raised from `ENV#fetch` and `Hash#fetch` now matches MRI's message formatting (see [#1633](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1633)).
`String#unicode_normalize` has been moved to the core library like in MRI.
`Module#define_method` is now public like in MRI.

##### Bug Fixes
* Fixed `rb_scan_args` to correctly handle keyword arguments in combination with optional args.
* Many fixes for `FFI::Pointer` to be more compatible with the `ffi` gem.

##### Changes
Support for the Darkfish theme for RDoc generation has been removed.

### JavaScript

##### Changes
[Loading JavaScript source code](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/docs/user/JavaScriptCompatibility.md#loadsource) from URLs is now guarded by the
`js.load-from-url` command line option and prohibited by default.

Project's
[changelog](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc16)
is available on GitHub.

### R

##### Compatibility
GraalVM implementation of **R** allows parsing any letter in identifiers
including, e.g., Japanese, with `lexer` starting from 1.0-RC16, which matches
GNU-R behavior.

To see a complete list of bug fixes, please refer to the project
[changelog](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-16).

### Python

##### Performance
Improved startup time of the `graalpython` native launcher.

### LLVM Runtime

##### Changes
The `lli` launcher now starts with the locale set to `C`.
