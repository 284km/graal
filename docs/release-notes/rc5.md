## 1.0-RC5

GraalVM 1.0-rc5 is the first release where we provide **pre-built binaries for GraalVM CE on macOS**. As always all binaries are available from the [downloads page](/downloads).

**KNOWN ISSUES**

* The GraalVM CE image for MacOS currently depends on some libraries that are not installed by default on current MacOS versions.
This might cause issues with UI-related functionality:
```
Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib
```
The necessary components can be added, e.g., by installing [https://www.xquartz.org](https://www.xquartz.org). We will remove this dependency in upcoming versions of GraalVM CE for MacOS.

### GraalVM for Java developers (GraalVM + compiler)

* 1.0-RC5 includes JVMCI changes necessary to support compiling Graal ahead of time and deploying as a shared library alongside `libjvm.so` (i.e., libgraal). Note that the implementation of _libgraal_ itself is not a part of this release as it is still under development.

### Native image generation

* Added API that allows an application to distinguish between native image building, native image runtime, and regular Java execution. For more information and documentation, look at the class  [ImageInfo](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sdk/src/org.graalvm.nativeimage/src/org/graalvm/nativeimage/ImageInfo.java).


### JavaScript

* Removed legacy NashornExtensions option, use `--js.nashorn-compat` instead.
* Added support for `Symbol.prototype.description`.
* Added support for `String.prototype.matchAll`.

More details can be found in the [project changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Ruby
The full [changelog is available](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the GitHub repository, but here are some of the most notable changes.

* Simpler installation on macOS: it is no longer needed to add LLVM (`/usr/local/opt/llvm@4/bin`) to PATH on macOS.
* `--log.ruby.level=` can be used to set the log level from any language launcher.
* `String#unpack1` has been implemented.
* Optimized required and optional keyword arguments.
* `-Dtruffleruby.log` and `TRUFFLERUBY_LOG` have been removed - use `-Dpolyglot.log.ruby.level`.
* The custom log levels `PERFORMANCE` and `PATCH` have been removed.

### Python

* Generator expressions now properly evaluate their first iterator in the definition scope at definition time.
* Fixes for embedders to ensure top scopes are stable and local scopes always contain TruffleObjects.
* C-API improvements to support simple Cython modules.
* Support recognition of Python source files with the polyglot launcher, so that now `--language python` is not necessary when starting Python scripts with the polyglot launcher (note that the polyglot launcher still needs to be rebuilt using `bin/gu rebuild-images polyglot` after installing Python).

Full changelog is available on GitHub [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### LLVM interpreter for C/C++ & other native languages

Changelog: [https://github.com/graalvm/sulong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/graalvm/sulong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

* Support the `__builtin_debugtrap` function based on LLVM's `@llvmn.debugtrap` intrinsic, which can be used to drop into the debugger (e.g., Chrome Inspector).
* Support "zero-length array at end of struct" pattern when accessing polyglot values as structs.
* Improved performance of global variable access.
* Improved support for vectorized bitcode operations generated by clang.

### API changes for GraalVM integrators

* Added new [execution listener API](http://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/management/ExecutionListener.html) that allows for simple, efficient and fine-grained introspection of executed code.
* Changed the default language context policy from `SHARED` to `EXCLUSIVE`, i.e. by default there is one exclusive language instance per polyglot or inner context. This can be configured by the language using the [context policy](http://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/TruffleLanguage.ContextPolicy.html).

To see the full list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:

* [Truffle changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/CHANGELOG.md)

### Tools
#### VisualVM
* VisualVM was added to the GraalVM CE distribution.
