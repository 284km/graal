## 1.0-RC15
(2019-04-05)

### Java

By default,
[libgraal](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/compiler#libgraal) is now
used when running the `java` launcher or when using the `--jvm` mode for the
language launchers. The **libgraal library** is a version of the Graal compiler
pre-compiled by `native-image`. In addition to improving startup time, libgraal
completely prevents the Graal compiler from interfering with the heap usage and
profiles of application code. It has execution properties similar to other
native HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2.

### JavaScript

* Enabled `Polyglot` builtin based on `Context.Builder.allowPolyglotAccess()`.
* Added rest and spread properties support for foreign objects. For example, this spread syntax is now supported:
```
var arr1 = [0, 1, 2];
var arr2 = [3, 4, 5];
arr1 = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // arr1 is now [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project [changelog](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc15).

### R

##### New Features

* Truffle interoperability API converts `double` values to `int` values if they
fit in the integer range. See the changes in the [spec
tests](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/commit/e08e2b19571479dddb6167d9a1d492a14cb4c7b2#diff-c842fa11097793b19bd410589c36af99).
* R incorrectly allowed Java interoperability when not started with `--jvm`.
Starting from 1.0-RC15, `--jvm` flag is again necessary to enable interoperability with Java.
* Implemented `gzcon` builtin for URL connections.

A complete project [changelog](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-15)  is available on GitHub.

### Ruby

An extensive list of changes is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-15).
Here is a short list of the most notable ones:

##### Changes
* Our experimental JRuby-compatible Java interop has been removed -- use `Polyglot` and `Java` instead.
* `Process.clock_getres` has been implemented.
* `debug`, `profile`, `profiler`, which were already marked as unsupported, have been removed.

##### Bug Fixes
* `autoload :C, "path"; require "path"` now correctly triggers the autoload.
* The shell standard library can now be `require`-d.

##### Compatibility
* Improved compatibility with MRI's `Float#to_s` formatting [#1626](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1626).
* Added support for the base keyword argument to `Dir.{[], glob}`.


### Python

##### Changes
* Migrated to the new Truffle libraries for interoperability support.
* Added support for importing Java classes from the `java` namespace using normal Python import syntax, e.g. `from java.util import ArrayList`.
* Implemented PEP 487 and PEP 560 to make the `typing` module work.

More details can be found in the [project changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc15).

### LLVM Interpreter

* Added  a preliminary support for bitcode produced by LLVM 8.

### Native Image

Based on the feedback and bug reports, we improved the agent that traces reflection
and JNI usage on the JavaHotSpot VM. We also changed the implementation language
of the agent from C to Java. The agent is now a Native Image itself.

The **native-image-maven-plugin** now supports multiline `buildArgs` and
boolean parameter `skip` (skip image building if true).

### API changes for GraalVM integrators (SDK + Truffle)

This version of GraalVM includes a major revision of the [Truffle
Interoperability
APIs](https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/interop/package-summary.html).
Most existing APIs for Truffle Interoperability were deprecated. The
compatibility layer may cause significant performance reduction for
interoperability calls. Please see the [Interop Migration
Guide](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/docs/InteropMigration.md)
for an overview and individual `@deprecated` javadoc tags for guidance.

We added Truffle Library API that allows language implementations to use
polymorphic dispatch for receiver types with support for implementation specific
caching/profiling with support for uncached dispatch. Please see the [Truffle
Library
Tutorial](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/docs/TruffleLibraries.md)
for further details.


The numerous changes were introduced to the GraalVM SDK Polyglot API as well:

* Renamed **Graal SDK** to [**GraalVM SDK**](https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/).
* Experimental options now require `--experimental-options` on the command line to
be passed to the GraalVM language launchers, or
`Context.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions` and
`Engine.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions` to be set in other scenarios.
For example, to diagnose the memory allocations of a JavaScript application with `--memtracer` profiling tool,
you should prepend `--experimental-options` option:
`js --experimental-options --memtracer program.js`.
* Added a possibility to set [an encoding in Source builder](https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/Source.Builder.html#encoding-java.nio.charset.Charset-).
* Added a new API for target type mappings using the new HostAccess API.

We summarized all Truffle and Graal SDK changes between GraalVM versions in separate changelogs:

- [GraalVM SDK changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sdk/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc15)
- [Truffle changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc15)

### Tools

#### Chrome Inspector

* Object Preview feature added for GraalVM implementation of JavaScript.
* Implemented a Custom Preview experimental feature for all languages supported by GraalVM.

#### Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)

Starting with 1.0-RC15 version of GraalVM, Ideal Graph Visualizer will be
provided as standalone download from [GraalVM
OTN](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/downloads/index.html)
pages. It is not part of GraalVM Community or Enterprise editions.
